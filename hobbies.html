        <h3>If you're here, then you are welcome to hear about my leisure hobbies!</h3>

        <p>Here is a list of them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Music</li>
                <p>Well music is an important part of my life, even when I learn I hear music
                    so you can image it's importance to me!
                </p>

            <li>Coding</li>
                <p>Coding is a kind of hobbie that I can't resist of, it really makes me dive
                    in into complex problems and kind of relaxes my brain! 
                </p>

            <li>Nature Avdentures</li>
                <p>I've always loved nature, almost every weekend I like to green my eyes and refresh my body 
                    hiking and walking, but sometimes also biking :D 
                </p>
        </ul>
